## Force Push Required

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: To complete this operation, the main branch needs to be force-pushed to the remote repository to overwrite the existing history. This will permanently remove all commits after `886743df02437fa463347d1b42db75af151346c9`.

The local main branch is ready and positioned at the correct commit. The next step requires administrative privileges to force-push to the remote main branch.

## Command to Complete (for repository administrator)

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

This will update the remote main branch to match the local state.
